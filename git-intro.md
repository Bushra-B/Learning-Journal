# Git commands
---------------
## Seeing Remotes:
* To view all specified remote handles, i.e. *origin*: use the `git remote` command
* To view all the remote URLs, along with their corresponding short names: use the `remote -v` command
### code example:
```
$ cd example
$ git remote -v
remote1 https://github.com/remote1/example (fetch)
remote1 https://github.com/remote1/example (push)
```
