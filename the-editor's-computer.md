# Text editors
--------------
**Text editors are software used to write and edit text either for documents or for coding.
Text editors can be either downloaded and installed on your device, or accessed online through web browsers.
It is an essential tool for programmers and web developers and so it should be chosen thoughtfully, but the choice of the text editor is merely personal.
And you can use the text editor software that comes with your computer, i.e. Notepad, or use third-party software.**

**Text editors are very important because they come with great features such as:**

* code completion
* syntax highlighting
* different themes
* Ability to add extensions

**So the choice of which text editor to use is important depending on the features you're looking for.**

# The command line
--------------------
**A command line is an interface to the system, in which you can add text commands and excute them.
In command line, commands are typed at prompts, and are the first thing to type after the prompt.
After the command you can type a command line argument which _must_ be separated from the command by spaces.
The first command line argument (aka *option*) starts with a dash and modifies the behaviour of the command.
The output from running the command will be listed under the issuing of the command. 
But note that some commands don't disply any information.**

## The shell:
**The shell is within the teminal and is a part of the operating system.**
**The shell defines the behaviour of the terminal and defines how the terminal will look after excuting the commands.**
- _echo_ command is used to know which shell you're using.
- *shortcut*: commands are stored in history, so you can use the up and down arrow keys to get the commands you previously typed.
