# Text editors
--------------
**Text editors are software used to write and edit text either for documents or for coding.
Text editors can be either downloaded and installed on your device, or accessed online through web browsers.
It is an essential tool for programmers and web developers and so it should be chosen thoughtfully, but the choice of the text editor is merely personal.
And you can use the text editor software that comes with your computer, i.e. Notepad, or use third-party software.**

**Text editors are very important because they come with great features such as:**

* code completion
* syntax highlighting
* different themes
* Ability to add extensions

**So the choice of which text editor to use is important depending on the features you're looking for.**
