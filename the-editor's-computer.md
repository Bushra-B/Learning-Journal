# Text editors
--------------
**Text editors are software used to write and edit text either for documents or for coding.
Text editors can be either downloaded and installed on your device, or accessed online through web browsers.
It is an essential tool for programmers and web developers and so it should be chosen thoughtfully, but the choice of the text editor is merely personal.
And you can use the text editor software that comes with your computer, i.e. Notepad, or use third-party software.**

**Text editors are very important because they come with great features such as:**

* code completion
* syntax highlighting
* different themes
* Ability to add extensions

**So the choice of which text editor to use is important depending on the features you're looking for.**

# The command line
--------------------
**A command line is an interface to the system, in which you can add text commands and execute them.
In the command line, commands are typed at prompts and are the first thing to type after the prompt.
After the command, you can type a command-line argument which _must_ be separated from the command by spaces.
The first command-line argument (aka *option*) starts with a dash and modifies the behavior of the command.
The output from running the command will be listed under the issuing of the command. 
But note that some commands don't display any information.**

## The shell:
**The shell is within the terminal and is a part of the operating system.**
**The shell defines the behavior of the terminal and defines how the terminal will look after executing the commands.**
- _echo_ command is used to know which shell you're using.
- *shortcut*: commands are stored in history, so you can use the up and down arrow keys to get the commands you previously typed.

## Important commands:
* `pwd` which stands for Print Working Directory: use this to know where you are currently (what your current or present working directory is)
    -it's important to know where you currently are when you're making commands because some commands depend on the location when excuted.
    
    - `pwd` command doesn't need argument.
    
* `ls` which is short for list: use this to list the contents of a directory
    - this is how you know what is there in the in the location you are in.
    
    - `ls` command can run with arguments and without arguments.
    
    - arguments (options) can be used with `ls` command as:  `ls[options][location]`
    
* `cd` which stands for Change Directories: use this to move to another directory
