# Introduction
---------------
## Javascript is used to make web pages more interactive by providing the following features:
1. Access Content
  - you can select any element, attribute or text from an HTML page

2. Modify Content
  - you can add or remove elements, attributes and text
  
3. Program Rules
  - you can give the browser accsess or let it change the content by giving it a set of specified steps
  
4. React to events
  - you can let the browser run a specific script after an event has occured, i.e., a button press or a link click
--------
**JS is powerful because it gives the ability to change an HTML page content while it's stil loading in the browser** 
and this is done by relying on the ability to: 
*Accsess
*Modify
*Program 
*React 
### Examples of using this ability in browsers are:
1. Slideshows
2. Forms
3. Reload part of the page
4. Filtering data

# The ABC of Programming
---------------------------

## A: Scripts
**A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal**
- a computer follow these instructions step-by-step
- a browser uses different part of the script depending on how the user interacts with the webpage
- a script run different sectoions of the code depending on the situation

**To write a script:**
1. state your goal
2. list the tasks you need to complete the task
3. Design the script
4. Code each step
--------
# Expressions
---------------
**An expressions result in a single value** 
## Types of expressions:
1. Expressions that assign a value to a variable; using the assignment (=)
2. expressions that tow or more values to return a single value; using *operators*
## Arithmetic Operators:
are operators which you can use with numbers.

--------|---|----------------------------------
addition| + |adds one value to another
---------|---| ---------------------------------
subtraction| - |subtracts one value from another
-----------|---|---------------------------------
division| / |divides two values 
--------|---|------------------------------------
multiplication| * |multiplies two values
--------------|---|------------------------------
increment| ++ |adds one to the current number 
---------|---|-----------------------------------
decrement| -- |subtracts one from the current value
---------|---|-------------------------------------
modulus| % |divids two values and returns the reminder
-------|---|-----------------------------------------


## The String Operator:
the string operator is (+) and it's used to add two strings and join them

# Functions
---------------
**Functions are used to perform a specific task withuot repeating yourself (the DRY principle) by grouping a series of statements together**
- some functions need *parameters* which are values used to achieve the task
- the answer or response provided by the function is called a *return value*
- a function must be given a *function name*, when you want the function to perform the task you *call* it using the function name

## Declaring a Function:
functions are declared as follows:
**function-keyword function-name(parameters) {**
    **statement;**
   **}**
## Calling a Function:
functions are called as follows:
**function-name(parameters);**
