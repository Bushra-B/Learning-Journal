# Duckett - ch18: Process and design - summary

## Tips for building and designing a website:

* When building a website, it's very important to consider the target audience
and design the website according to the information you have about them.

* Organize the information you want to present into sections or pages.

* Use a "site map" to help design your website.
site maps are diagrams of the pages that will be used to structure the site.

* Another useful technique is "card sorting", which is used to
help you decide what information should go on each page.

## Wireframes:
* A wireframe is a simple sketch of the key information that needs to go on each page of a site

* Wireframe involves sketching or shading areas where each element of the page will go 

* By creating a wireframe you can ensure that all of the information that needs to be on a page is included.


* The wireframes make design easier because you know what information needs to appear on which page

## Design to communicate:
* Organizing and prioritizing information on a page helps users understand its importance and what order to read it in

* Content design includes:
    - A masthead or logo 
    - Links to navigate the site
    - Links to related content
    - Login or membership options
    - Copyright information
 
* Grouping together related content into blocks or chunks makes the page look simpler, by presenting certain types of information in a similar visual style
