## Tips for building and designing a website:

* When building a website, it's very important to consider the target audience
and design the website according to the information you have about them.

* Organize the information you want to present into sections or pages.

* Use a "site map" to help design your website.
site maps are diagrams of the pages that will be used to structure the site.

* Another useful technique is "card sorting", which is used to
help you decide what information should go on each page.
