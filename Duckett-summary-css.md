# CSS Intro
------------
- CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside  X its own box and uses rules to indicate how that element should look.

- Rules are made up of selectors and declarations

- Different types of selectors allow you to target your  X rules at different elements

- Declarations are made up of two parts: 
    * the properties of the element that you want to change 
    * and the values of those properties
- CSS rules usually appear in a separate document, although they may appear within an HTML page

- Colors help bring your site to life

- Colors in CSS are specified by:
    * RGB values
    * Hex codes
    * Color names

- You can find the color you want using color-picker

- Pay attention to contrast, it's important to enable readers to read your content, there must be
enough contrast between the text and the background
