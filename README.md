# Welcome to my learning journal.
----------------------------------
**Hi! I am Bushra.\
I'm someone who enjoys learning new stuff and challenging myself so I keep this learning journal where I explain why continuous learning and *growth mindset* is important and to remind myself to stay in that mindset, and it's also a place for me to keep my notes of the things that I'm learning./
Currently, I'm learning software development and I'll post my notes in this journal.\
Hope you enjoy it!**

## Growth Mindset:
To me, *growth mindset* is about the internal beliefs that orient my behaviour toward learning and trying to expand my potential and be the best version of myself.

### Quotes to keep me in the growth mindset:

> “To reach your greatest potential you'll have to fight your greatest fears.”

> “It is our attitude at the beginning of a difficult task which, more than anything else, will affect its successful outcome.”
   - William James
   
> “The master has failed more times than the beginner has even tried.”
   - Stephen McCranie
   
> “Don't be pushed by your problems. Be led by your dreams.”
  - Ralph Waldo Emerson
