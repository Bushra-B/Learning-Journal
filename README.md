# Welcome to my learning journal.

**I am Bushra Bilal.
I'm a constant learner so I keep this learning journal where I explain why continouse learning and *growth mindset* is important and to remind myself to stay in that mindset.**

## Growth Mindset:
To me, *growth mindset* is about the internal beliefs that orient my behaviour toward learning and trying to expand my potential and be more.
