# Welcome to my learning journal.
----------------------------------
**Hi! I am Bushra.  
I'm someone who enjoys learning new stuff and challenging myself so I keep this learning journal where I explain why continuous learning and *growth mindset* is important and to remind myself to stay in that mindset, and it's also a place for me to keep my notes of the things that I'm learning.  
I'm generally interested in science and technology.  
I studied *physics* in college, and currently, I'm learning _software development_.  
I'll post my notes in this journal.  
Hope you enjoy it!**

## Growth Mindset:
To me, *growth mindset* is about the internal beliefs that orient my behaviour toward learning and trying to expand my potential and be the best version of myself.

### Quotes to keep me in the growth mindset:

> “It is our attitude at the beginning of a difficult task which, more than anything else, will affect its successful outcome.”
   - William James
   
> “The master has failed more times than the beginner has even tried.”
   - Stephen McCranie
   
> “Don't be pushed by your problems. Be led by your dreams.”
  - Ralph Waldo Emerson
