# Comparision operators
-----------------------
- `==` 
compares the *values* to see if they are the same

- `!=` 
compares the *values* to see if they are not the same

- `===` 
compares the values to check if the data types are the same

- `!===`
compares the values to check if the data types are not the same

- `>` 
checks if the number on the left is greater than the number on the right

- `<`
checks if the number on the left is less than the number on the right

- `>=`
checks if the number on the left is greater than or equal the number on the right

- `<=`
checks if the number on the left is less than or equal the number on the right

# Logical operators
---------------------
- `&&`
T && T : T
T && F : F
F && T : F
F && F : F

- `||`
T || T : T
T || F : T
F || T : T 
F || F : F

-`!~
!T : F
!F : T

# Loops
---------
**The idea of a loop is to have a condition and a code block, such that the code block will keep repeating as long as the condition checks true**
## Types of loops:
1. For loop
    - when you need to run the code for a specific number of times
    - the condition is a counter
2. While loop
    - if you don't know how many times you should run the code
    - the code will keep looping as long as the condition is true
3. Do While
    - same as while loop
    - runs all the code statements at least once even if the condition is false
